`[IUPAC codes](http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/iupac.html#:~:text=IUPAC%20codes.%20The%20International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and,to%20represent%20multiple%20observed%20alleles%20of%20single-base%20polymorphisms.)`
The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has defined a standard representation of DNA bases by single characters that specify either a single base (e.g. G for guanine, A for adenine) or a set of bases (e.g. R for either G or A). UCSC uses these single character codes to represent multiple observed alleles of single-base polymorphisms.
